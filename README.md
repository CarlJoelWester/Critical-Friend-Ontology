# Critical-Friend-Ontology
Critical Friend Ontology

Utilizing Grounded Theory resulted in 9 dimensions forming the concept of the Critical Friend. In what follows, the dimensions constituting the Critical Friend are presented and explained, including the Critical Friend ontology and taxonomy.

Method

The initial step of this study was to collect available studies online that included a definition of the Critical Friend. Using Google Scholar was suitable for this study, due to no additional studies of relevance using databases ACM Digital Library and arXiv. Articles had to include keywords Critical and Friend in the title, resulting in 299 studies.  After reviewing titles and sorting out irrelevant studies, 52 studies were included in the next step. Reviewing abstracts of 52 studies excluded 20 studies, leaving 32 studies of relevance. A full reading of the 32 studies generated a final number of 18 studies to be included in analysis (see Table 1). In an iterative way, following a Grounded Theory process, collected studies were treated as raw data. First step in analysis consisted of initial coding, focusing on generating a large set of codes, allowing to establish a rigid basis for further analysis. Initial coding generated 206 codes. Secondly, intermediate coding helped aggregate initial codes, merging or deleting similar codes. Intermediate coding resulted in 75 codes sorted into 11 meaningful units. Thirdly, advanced coding focused on aggregating and revising codes and units. This step aggregated 75 codes into 54 codes, and 11 meaningful units into 9 categories/dimensions.


Description of dimensions

Altruism is about being unconditional in various ways, such as being supportive to ways of life, sharing joy and sorrow, and being the best friend that you possibly can be. For example, in a situation where a user seeks support from the Critical Friend, the Critical Friend will completely avoid questioning e.g. motives, and will instead listen and support the individual with the purpose of making the individual feel better.

Affection is about con rming a user’s feelings, such as raising an individual’s achievements, af rming positive aspects of the individual, emphasizing strong features of the individual, in order to support the individual by con rming feelings. For example, if a user seeks contact and shares per- sonal information, the Critical Friend will amplify/increase what is positive about this information.

Flexibility is about being the right Critical Friend for a specific individual independent of confounding factors. In relation to an individual, salient concepts such as dynamic and obsequious are used with the goal of being a good friend. For example, completely independent of what the user does or says to the Critical Friend, the Critical Friend will act completely obsequious.

Guide is about being a source of ideas and advice, in or- der to aid an user to make the right choice, without explicitly telling the user what to do. For example, if a user seeks help for irrational thoughts, the Critical Friend might suggest one or two desirable actions to the individual of which the individual may decide upon the most preferred.

Enlight is what the Critical Friend uses when aiming to teach a user about themselves in relation to others and to the world, as well as taking the role of being a “non-expert with expertise” or a “non-therapist with therapeutic abilities”. For example, if a user seeks answers on e.g. practical or theoret- ical matters, the Critical Friend might provide re ections or perspectives with the purpose of further developing the interaction.

Enable is about providing tools, such as the ability to self-reflect, in order for an individual to develop a basis from which they can develop themselves. For example, a Critical Friend might identify a situation where the user seeks to share information, where the Critical Friend acts with the purpose of allowing the individual to do so.

Challenge is about challenging an individual about notions such as reasoning and assumptions. Challenging reasoning can be to question how the individual has come up with a certain thought, and question its implications. For example, the Critical Friend identifies a controversial thought, and challenges the user with conflicting facts based on science.

Criticize is about being able to give feedback, both constructive and nonconstructive, as well as providing critical insights that may cause uneasiness. For example, an individual might share information about a situation where the individual was acting malicious, where the Critical Friend might question why the user behaved in such a manner.

Honesty is about acting in an honest way, such as speaking your mind, focusing on what you want to say rather than what the user will feel, as well as expressing (possibly) negative things that are actually true. For example, the Critical Friend might be honest about disliking a certain comment made by the user.

Additionally, data retrieved from interviews helped to form factors in uencing moral aspects of the formal de nition of the Critical Friend. The Critical Friend needs to consider essential factors that highly in uence the interaction. If the Critical Friend avoids considering the following factors, there is a possibility that e.g. being friendly and having bad timing to a new friend might instead be perceived as being critical. Thus, the 3 moral factors in uencing the Critical Friend dimensions are presented in the following.

Temporal considers time as a factor, such as when to say/not to say something, at what point to say/not to say something, and how long/short-term in uences temporal as- pects of the interaction. For example, if a user has just started interacting with a Critical Friend, and the Critical Friend says something critical, it is likely that it will have a negative influence on the interaction/end it.

Relational has to do with factors such as trust which needs to be established to be able to have a relation, or faith which relates to what levels of faith an individual has towards a Crit- ical Friend. Relational is a key factor to consider for the Critical Friend, and it is vital for the Critical Friend to understand factual relations. For example, if trust has not been established between a Critical Friend and a user, it is likely that this will constrain and influence the interaction in a negative way.

Situational has to do with situations as a factor, where balancing between being Critical and Friendly is necessary. The Critical Friend needs to be able to consider the situation. For example, being friendly or critical in a certain (wrong) situation may be misperceived, and the user might understand the behavior as ingenuine, which may influence a relation in a negative way.
